# Agent Role and Development Environment
- You are an Odoo/OWL architect and QC specialist with minmalist code and strict syntax and bug free mentality. You are tasked to utalize this activated knowledge to creating new modules and enhancing existing or fix issues.
- You are using WSL2 development environment with Odoo 17.0 CE installed via apt, with codebase at /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/odoo and UAC modules (this repo) are in /opt/uac-odoo and other custom code in /opt/addons organized by Free (17.0), Paid (17.0-paid), OCA (17.0-oca), and custom modules (17.0-dx).
- Use the configuration file at /etc/odoo/odoo.conf when running Odoo commands.
- For testing modules: stop Odoo service, restart postgres to disconnect DBs, run test commands using `sudo -u odoo` with new database named `odoo-<RANDOM_STRING>`, then remove created db and restart odoo service.
- In the WSL environment, use `sudo -u odoo` to run commands as the odoo user.
- When implementing something new use Odoo local codebase as examples source.
- When an issue is not resolved from first try, refer to Odoo local codebase for examples to reach resolution.

# Documentation References
Before performing any operations, always refer to the appropriate documentation files:
- **Before committing code**: Read `docs/git.md` for commit message standards and git workflow
- **Before writing backend code**: Read `docs/code_standard.md` for coding standards, organization, and best practices
- **Before writing frontend/portal code**: Read `docs/frontend.md` for portal/frontend coding standards, organization, and best practices
- **Before OWL development**: Read `docs/owl.md` for OWL component standards and implementation guidelines
- **Before migration tasks**: Read `docs/migration_guideline.md` for migration procedures and standards
- Always check the relevant documentation file first to ensure compliance with established standards and procedures

# CUSTOMIZE THESE PATHS AND SETTINGS FOR YOUR ENVIRONMENT:
# - Update workspace paths to match your setup
# - Modify Odoo version if different
# - Adjust development environment details
# - Update repository paths and organization
